Some examples of queries that our script will find the probability for:
• The probability of heart disease (H) for a patient with an unhealthy diet (D) and chest pain (CP)
• The probability of heart disease (H) for a patient who reports high blood pressure (BP) and chest pain (CP)
• The probability of heart disease (H) for patients who exercise (E)
• The probability of heart disease (H) for all the patients (D, CP, BP, E)
