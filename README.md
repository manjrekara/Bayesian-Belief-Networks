# Bayesian-Belief-Networks
A script to calculate the probability of simple queries, given the general correlation of factors provided by a Bayesian Network

A Bayesian Network:

Some examples of queries that our script will find the probability for:
1. The probability of heart disease (H) for a patient with an unhealthy diet (D) and chest pain (CP)

2. The probability of heart disease (H) for a patient who reports high blood pressure (BP) and chest pain (CP)

3. The probability of heart disease (H) for patients who exercise (E)

4. The probability of heart disease (H) for all the patients (D, CP, BP, E)





Ouput for a patient who exercises and has a unhealthy diet:

Ouput for a patient who has an unhealthy diet and chest pain:
